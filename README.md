# Masonite

------

#### A simple static website generator using HTML with light templating and Stylus for CSS preprocessing

Masonite is a simple static site generator. It uses HTML for templating (still kind of hacked together, but HTML5 should bring some real templating features to the field), and stylus for CSS preprocessing.

Feel free to hack around with it.

## Install

To install run `npm install masonite`.
